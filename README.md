# Isometric

<h1>Overview</h1>
"Isometric" is a Godot GDScript project to be used as a base for isometric real-time strategy games.
The models were created using Blender, and rendered as spritesheets using a <a href="https://github.com/PaulBenMarsh/BlenderAPI-IsometricSpritesheet">Python script via the Blender API</a>.

Technically, it should be called "Dimetric". A true isometric projection looks slightly different.

Fun fact: the file size of this .gif is larger than the size of the entire project.
