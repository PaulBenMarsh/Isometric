# Isometric

<h1>Overview</h1>
"Isometric" is a Godot GDScript project to be used as a base for isometric real-time strategy games.
The models were created using Blender, and rendered as spritesheets using a <a href="https://github.com/PaulBenMarsh/BlenderAPI-IsometricSpritesheet">Python script via the Blender API</a>.
A final, playable version will be available in the future on my website.
The project will be ported to a Single Page Application using Phaser.io and the MERN-Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJS).

Technically, it should be called "Dimetric", since the game doesn't really employ a true isometric projection.

Fun fact: the file size of this .gif is larger than the file size of the entire project.
