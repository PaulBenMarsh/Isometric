# Isometric

<h1>Overview</h1>
"Isometric" is a Godot GDScript project to be used as a base for isometric real-time strategy games.
The models were created using Blender, and rendered as spritesheets using a Python script via the Blender API.
A final playable version will be available in the future on my website.
The project will be ported to a Single Page Application using Phaser.io and the MERN-Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJS).

Technically, it should be called "Dimetric", since the game doesn't really employ a true isometric projection.
